I have 3+ years of Consulting Experience in Technology and Digital Tranformation. Currently, I am a member of Boston Consulting Group's Customer Journeys and F2B Transformation practice, where I have supported more than 35 ambitious programs across the Banking, Insurance, Public Sector, Hospitality, and B2B SaaS industries. My work at BCG has been varied, and included product roadmapping, workshop planning & moderation, conducting due dilligences, industry benchmarking, expert interviewing, client pitches, and agile product design.

Beyond my formal employment at BCG and Deloitte, I have also worked as an Inspire lo-bono Consultant, working with the Chicago area non-profit Sisters in Cinema. I developed a fundraising strategy and configured a CRM system to improve fundraising capacity on their behalf so that staff could focus on their mission of improving young Chicagoan's access to the arts.

# Non-Work Stuff
