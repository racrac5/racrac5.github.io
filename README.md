My work at BCG has been varied, and included product roadmapping, workshop planning & moderation, conducting due dilligences, industry benchmarking, expert interviewing, client pitches, and agile product design.  

Previously, I was an Anaslyst at Deloitte in the Customer & Marketing Life Sciences Practice working as a business analyst and APM on SaaMD (software as a medical device) products for Diabetes as well as Neurological and Immunological conditions.
