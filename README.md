## Professional Experience

### Consulting

I have 3+ years of Consulting Experience in Technology and Digital Transformation. I was most recently a member of the Boston Consulting Group's Customer Journeys and F2B Transformation practice, where I supported more than 35 ambitious programs across the Banking, Insurance, Public Sector, Hospitality, and B2B SaaS industries. My work included product roadmapping, workshop planning & moderation, conducting due diligence, industry benchmarking, expert interviews, client pitches, and agile product design.  

Previously, I was an Analyst at Deloitte in the Customer & Marketing Life Sciences Practice working as a business analyst and APM on SaaMD (software as a medical device) products for Diabetes as well as Neurological and Immunological conditions.

Beyond my formal employment at BCG and Deloitte, I have also worked as an Inspire pro-bono Consultant, working with the Chicago area non-profit Sisters in Cinema. I developed a fundraising strategy and configured a CRM system to improve fundraising capacity on their behalf so that staff could focus on their mission of improving young Chicagoan's access to the arts.
